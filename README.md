### Contributions
- [x] This study introduced some pretrained weights for the pediatric delirium recognition task. This study developed a hybrid deep learning architecture integrating pretrained models and finetuned classifier, achieving a accuracy of 0.8718 on hold-out inter-patient test sets.
- [x] The trained model was deployed on secured medical servers with a clinician-accessible interface, and the source code will be made publicly available upon publication.
