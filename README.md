### Updates
- [ ] Paper (Waiting for its publication, which included detailed information)
- [x] The training, application algorithm
- [x] The models
- [ ] Pretrained weights
### Contributions
- [x] This study introduced some pretrained weights for the pediatric delirium recognition task. This study developed a hybrid deep learning architecture integrating pretrained models and finetuned classifier, achieving a accuracy of 0.8718 on hold-out inter-patient test sets.
- [x] The trained model was deployed on secured medical servers with a clinician-accessible interface, and the source code will be made publicly available upon publication.
